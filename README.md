# Depression Analysis Using Excel

This project involves data cleaning, preprocessing, and exploratory analysis of a large dataset (140,700 entries) to investigate the prevalence and contributing factors of depression among students and working professionals. All analysis and transformations were performed using Microsoft Excel.

## Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
1. Dataset Preparation: Copied the raw dataset into a new sheet for backup and safe handling.
2. Null Value Treatment: Identified and handled missing values in key columns:
  * Profession, Academic Pressure, Work Pressure, CGPA, Study Satisfaction, Work Satisfaction, Dietary Habits, Degree, Financial Stress.
  * Replaced null values in Financial Stress with the column's average.
  * Filled null values in Profession based on Working Professional or Student classification.
  * For CGPA: Students Filled with the average CGPA and Non-students Marked as Not a Student.
3. Data Quality Improvements:
  * Checked for and found no duplicate rows.
  * Cleaned and standardized Dietary Habits column. Unclear entries marked as Unknown Habit.
  * Cleaned the City column by fixing typos and replacing invalid entries with Unknown.
  * Cleaned Degree entries.
4. Created new columns:
  * Work/Academic Pressure (combined Work Pressure and Academic Pressure)
  * Work/Study Satisfaction (combined Work Satisfaction and Study Satisfaction)
